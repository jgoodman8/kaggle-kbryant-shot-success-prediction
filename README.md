Kobe Bryant marked his retirement from the NBA by scoring 60 points in his final game as a Los Angeles Laker on Wednesday, April 12, 2016. Drafted into the NBA at the age of 17, Kobe earned the sportâ€™s highest accolades throughout his [long career](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474107238/kobe-bryants-life-and-career-by-the-numbers).

This data contains the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant took during his 20-year career. Your task is to predict whether the basket went in (shot_made_flag). We have removed 5000 of the shot_made_flags (represented as missing values in the csv file). These are the test set shots for which you must submit a prediction. You are provided a sample submission file with the correct shot_ids needed for a valid prediction.

Submissions are evaluated on the log loss.
